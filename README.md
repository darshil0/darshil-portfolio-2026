# Darshil Shah — QA Leadership & Digital Transformation Portfolio

**v2026.5.25** · React 19 + Vite · Deployed via GitHub Pages

## Overview

This is a production-ready personal portfolio for **Darshil Shah**, a Global Healthcare QA Leader and AI-driven Testing Engineer with 14+ years of experience. It is built with React 19, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, and deploys automatically to GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions.

## Recent Fixes (2026-05-25)

- **Test hook sync**: Corrected stale `10+ years` string in `index.html` test-hook div to `14+ years`, resolving a `tests/content.test.js` assertion failure.
- **Tailwind border radius**: Restored missing `2xl` and `3xl` radius keys and corrected `full` from `0.75rem` to `9999px` in `tailwind.config.js`, fixing visual breakage across 70+ component instances.
- **Assistant data sync**: Updated `assistantData.personal.background` from "over 10 years" to "over 14 years" to match all other surfaces (metadata, README, UI).

## Newcomer Guide

Welcome to the portfolio. If you are visiting for the first time, start here:

1. **Meet Jules**: Click the bot icon in the bottom-right corner to open the Jules AI Assistant. It can guide you through the repositories and share background on my professional journey.
2. **Explore the sections**: Use the top navigation menu to move through the portfolio.
3. **Review the metrics**: The Impact section highlights quantified results from 14+ years of QA leadership.
4. **Open the projects**: Each project card links to its repository for deeper technical review.

## Quick Start

### Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev # http://localhost:5173
```

### Production Build

```bash
npm run build # outputs to ./dist
```

### Tests

```bash
npm test
npm run test:e2e
```

## Deployment

Pushes to `main` trigger the GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/static.yml`. The workflow installs dependencies, runs `npm run build`, and deploys `./dist` to GitHub Pages automatically.

The Vite config uses `base: './'`, which keeps built asset paths relative so the site works correctly when served from a GitHub Pages subdirectory.

Content for each section lives in its corresponding component under `src/components/Sections/`. Experience bullets, certification data, and project descriptions are defined as inline arrays within their respective files.

AI Assistant content (repository metadata, personal background, Q&A) lives in `src/constants/assistantData.js`.

## Certifications

The portfolio includes **100+** certifications from Anthropic, DeepLearning.AI, IBM, Coursera, Google, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, PMI, Scrum Inc., and Scrum Alliance, spanning AI/ML, Cloud, DevOps, Agile, Leadership, and Technical tracks.
